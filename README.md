## I'm Jazmin! 👋

A little bit about me:
- Graduate from the **University of Chicago** and of the **Northwestern University** Full-stack Coding Bootcamp
- Current **Software Engineering Apprentice** at **Google**, graduating May 2025
- Interested in **artificial intelligence** and **animation** and their impact on the **user experience**


When I'm not coding, I'm out and about taking in Chicago's thriving music scene and exploring my wonderful city. I'm also an avid gamer - my love for the Pokemon games on the GameBoy Advance kicked off my interest in tech and is part of the reason why I'm in this space today! My goal is to always lead with empathy no matter what, both personally and professionally.

## Currently Working On... 🚀

Check back soon! Currently I am solidifying my fundamentals in my languages and tools of choice while gearing up to work on my next advanced project - hopefully to incorporate both AI and complex animation.
